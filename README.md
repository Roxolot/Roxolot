Hi i'm Roxolot.

Im a cybersecurity engineer and developer.

I like CTF's, backend development, server configuration and doing powershell and bash scripting.

So far i've experience coding in Java, Python and JavaScript but i can do some stuff in C++ and manage some tools like Burpsuite, Wireshark and Virtual Machines.

To learn languages i do some "coding challenges" like Conway's game of life so i can learn the basics and some graphic stuff

For example this was my attempt to learn python back the day: ![Coway's game of life on python](https://github.com/Roxolot/python-GoL)
